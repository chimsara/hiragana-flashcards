# Hiragana Flashcards - _Practice Hiragana!_
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
Hiragana Flashcards is a small application that helps beginners study Hiragana. Knowing Hiragana lays the foundation of your first month of studying Japanese!

The application quizzes the user on various hiragana characters, based on the user's desired amount. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, highlighting the questions answered correctly and incorrectly.

## What I Learned

For this project, I utilized Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React JS Library. I learned about the foundations of React JS, how to use routing for a multi-page website, and importing JSON objects to use their data.
