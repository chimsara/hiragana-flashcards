# Hiragana Flashcards - _Practice Hiragana!_

Hiragana Flashcards is a website that beginners study Japanese. The application quizzes the user on various hiragana characters, based on the user's desired amount. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, highlighting the questions answered correctly or incorrectly. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What I Learned

For this project, I utilized Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React JS Library. I learned about the foundations of React JS, how to use routing for a multi-page website, and importing JSON objects to use their data.
